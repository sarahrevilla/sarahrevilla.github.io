## About

I am a PhD student in Hispanic Studies at UBC,
where I am supervised by Dr. Tamara Mitchell.
My most recent research centers around gendered violence in Mexico,
specifically feminicidio, and the affects engendered between
living bodies and dead bodies through manifestations of
public mourning, artivism (art+activism) and contemporary literature.
My research also explores monstrous representations of
women in North American and Latin American popular culture,
as well as the intersection between Mexican masculinity and neoliberalism.

My research lies at the intersection of gender and cultural studies in contemporary Mexico,
with a particular interest in literature, popular culture, and artivism (art+activism).

Before coming to UBC,
I completed a master's degree in Comparative Literature at Brock University
(2017&ndash;2018) with Dr. Cristina Santos
and a master's degree in Sociology
at the University of Victoria (2019&ndash;2021) with Dr. Steve Garlick.
