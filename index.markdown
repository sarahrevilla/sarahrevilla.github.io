<!--
My most recent research centers around gendered violence in Mexico,
specifically feminicidio, and the affects engendered between
living bodies and dead bodies through manifestations of
public mourning, artivism (art+activism) and contemporary literature.
My research also explores monstrous representations of
women in North American and Latin American popular culture,
as well as the intersection between Mexican masculinity and neoliberalism.

## Research

<span style="color:black;">
My doctoral research lies at the intersection of gender-based violence,
contemporary Mexican Gothic fiction, and feminism. 
Other research interests include Testimony, Digital Humanities, 
and Sound Studies.
</span>

<span style="color:black;">
My dissertation tracks how contemporary literary works by 
Mexican women are increasingly engaging with the Gothic mode 
to grapple with gender-based violence. 
Drawing on Gothic and Horror Studies, Gender Theories, and Feminist Studies, 
I demonstrate that the authors in my corpus not only capture and portray 
the horrors of patriarchal violence, 
but they do so in ways that expose the entanglement among 
gender, class, race, politics, and neoliberal logic.

### Other projects

**The Adaptive TEI Network: Antiracist, Decolonial, and Inclusive Markup Interventions**

<span style="color:black;">
I’m collaborating with other graduate students, faculty, 
and DH librarians at UBC and SFU to co-write a new TEI schema 
that attends to antiracist, decolonial, inclusive, and feminist practices 
for encoding and analyzing texts in digital form. 
I’m currently learning XML-TEI.

**(Re)appearing the Desaparecidos: Testimonial Mural Art and Intergenerational Trauma of the Argentinean Dictatorship (1976–1983)**

<span style="color:black;">
Since 2020, I have been working as a Research Assistant 
under the supervision of Dr. [Cristina Santos](https://brocku.ca/humanities/modern-languages/faculty-and-staff/cristina-santos/) 
and Dr. Adriana Spahr. 
This interdisciplinary project examines 
Argentinean testimonial art production and testimonies. 
As part of my duties, 
I am transcribing and translating (Spanish/English) testimonies. 
As a research team, we travelled to Buenos Aires 
to conduct field work (June 2022) 
and co-organized an international conference in Canada. 
Read more about that event [here](https://brocku.ca/brock-news/2024/02/humanities-research-event-to-explore-trauma-historical-erasure/).

**Sound and the Humanities Research Cluster (2022-2024)**

<span style="color:black;">
I worked as a Research Assistant for my supervisor, Dr. Tamara Mitchell. 
In addition to maintaining the cluster’s [website](https://sound.arts.ubc.ca/), 
I co-facilitated discussions in reading groups, 
and created a podcast episode! Coming soon.
